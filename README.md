# Natural-hydrogen-FEM-simulation
Rampart carbon emissions have prompted various countries to adopt a safe and clean environment strategy. In this regard, natural hydrogen plays a vital role in the overall elimination of such emissions. This natural hydrogen is stored deep in shale reservoirs and is generated via different processes which range from Sepertinization, radiolysis, to mention but a few. This file demonstrates how to simulate the natural hydrogen storage, flow, and production in shale reservoirs using the finite element method. The simulation procedure is:
